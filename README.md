The CRUD acronym identifies all of the major functions that are inherent to relational databases and the applications used to manage them, which include Oracle Database, Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL, and others.

The four CRUD functions can perform different types of operations on selected data within the database.

CRUD operations are widely used in many applications that are supported by underlying relational databases.
